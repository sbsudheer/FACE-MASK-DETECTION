# FACE-MASK-DETECTION
checks whether people wear mask or not

INTRODUCTION

Face mask detection is the ability to quickly determine the presence of face masks in large groups of people, or inside buildings, has been an ongoing challenge. While an individual might be wearing a face mask upon entry, they might remove their mask at some point â€“ violating a local, government or other policy.

MOTIVATION

In the present scenario due to Covid-19,Identifying those with and without a mask on can be tricky, especially as protecting the health and safety of the general public remains a concern. Human intervention alone is not able to handle this task, especially in situations like public transportation, where face masks are mandated on buses, trains and airplanes, or for college campuses which may require students and faculty wear a mask throughout campus.
